## Exploring the integration between Thunder (Spark) and HDF5

This ipython notebook comes as a collaborative effort between [Jeremy Freeman](https://github.com/freeman-lab/), [Cyrille Rossant](https://github.com/rossant) and [Roman Valls](https://github.com/brainstorm/) to explore the idea exposed in a
[blog post](http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/2014/11/20/neuroinformatics_without_borders/) written during the [Neuroinformatics Without Borders](http://crcns.org/NWB) event.

The idea is to invite the electrophysiology community to use high performance frameworks such as Thunder/Spark **while** using
their already semi-stablished data format standards, such as [KWIK](https://github.com/klusta-team/kwiklib/wiki/Kwik-format).
